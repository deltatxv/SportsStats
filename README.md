## Idea
Simple CLI tool to see current sports scores and box scores without having to navigate to a special app or website.

## Motivation
I like to watch live sports (esp. NBA and NFL) in my browser on a separate monitor while I multitask. I find myself constantly checking the updated box score on websites like espn.com or nfl.com or nba.com, but they seem to cause my stream to drop frames. I'm an avid sports fan, but only care about a small number of stats. I want to get a quick box score update in the terminal but haven't been able to find something like this publicly available.
