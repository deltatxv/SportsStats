## BUGS
- streaming link doesn't always use home team name []

## Improvements:
- show time left in the quarter if ongoing []
- improve formatting of score to show who's winning better []

## Tech Debt:
- cleaner code for getting strings to output []
- #### Use [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) [ ]

## General Ideas:
- box scores []
  - work started here...

## Box Score TODO:
1. code to get box score info per player []
2. code to convert received json into player performance objects that hold their stat lines []
3. pretty print box score info for all players of a game []
4. ...

## Store all historical data in sqlite:

<!-- ## Future

  - ALL player-specific data
    - player avg stats
    - player injury statuses
    - player fatigue
  - experimental stuff
    - stories about players in the news
    - info about player motivations like (playing for contract, all star nod, award, etc.)
